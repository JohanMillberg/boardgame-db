# Boardgame DB
## What?
This API will support a web app where users are able to post reviews of boardgames, read each others reviews, and comment on these. A user will also be able to read all reviews made for a particular game.
## Why?
The primary point of this project is for me to practice my fullstack development skills. This is also a web app that I think would be of interest for boardgame enthusiasts to help them connect and get recommendations on what to play next.
